Popovers

Popovers are used to provide additional content to a user on pages that have
limited space. Content elements, such as paragraphs, divs, or table cells,
will have an icon inserted at the end of the element automatically to provide
an obvious interaction point for a user.

Action elements, such as buttons, links, or inputs, will have a popup on focus
or hover, but it is up to the implementer to provide an icon.

markup:
<div>
	<button popover="Look a popover!">Sample Popover</button>
    <button popover popover-title="Example Popover Title" popover="This is a popover with a title">Popover With Title</button>
    <button popover popover-template="">Complex Popover</button>
	<p popover="Some extra information about this paragraph" popover-title="Sample Title">
		Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
